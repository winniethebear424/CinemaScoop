## Project Topic: Movie rating website
## Description: 
This project involves the development of an online movie rating software product, designed to provide users with comprehensive features for interacting with movie-related content. The primary functionalities of this application include, but are not limited to, a search system for finding specific movies, a review system where users can read, write, edit, and delete their own reviews, and a rating system where users can score movies based on their personal assessments. The software will also provide detailed information on the cast and crew involved in the movie, such as the actors, director, and more. Users will be able to easily navigate through an extensive database of films, participate in a dynamic rating system, and engage in lively discussions about their favorite movies.
Next.js framework is used, using RESTful architecture style design, by the background through a unified data query service, through  MongoDb to achieve data storage, through the http protocol and axios to achieve the interaction of front and back data, to achieve search function.
